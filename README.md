## 📣 Latest News

- **[November 13, 2025]**: 📄 Our paper is now available on **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09148v1)** and **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/papers/2511.09148)**.
- **[November 13, 2025]**: 🚀 Our codebase released. You can use LoopTool to construct **specific dialogues for your own toolset**, andn finetune language model optimized for particular tools using RL algorithms. You can further refine performance by iteratively updating the training data and the model training process.

## 💡 Overview

Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. 

We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. 

Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

### 📊 Overall Performance

We compare LoopTool-8B and LoopTool-32B with various representation models in [BFCL-v3](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/blogs/13_bfcl_v3_multi_turn.html) and [ACEBench](https://chenchen0103.github.io/ACEBench/). We adopt the official evaluation script and report the average accuracy across categories. On both BFCL-v3 and ACEBench leaderboards, LoopTool-8B achieves SOTA performance among all 8B-scale open-source models and exceeds several larger counterparts. LoopTool‑32B achieves the top position in BFCL‑v3, demonstrates the best performance among open‑source models in ACEBench, and ranks second overall, immediately following GPT‑4o.

### ✨ The LoopTool Framework

![Framework](<./figures/framework.png>)

**Key Features:**
- **Seed Data Generation**: We support a customizable toolset, utilizing a multi‑agent simulation framework to generate dialogue flows centered on a specific toolset. The overall architecture comprises the Planner, User, Assistant, and Tool.

- **End-to-End RL Training with [Verl](https://github.com/volcengine/verl)**: We support the transformation of specific tool‑invocation dialogues into samples adapted for model reinforcement learning training. By integrating the Verl library, we provide supervision over the model’s tool‑invocation steps.

- **Iterative Data and Model Evolution**: LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures.

## 🔧 Installation

###  Environment Setup
```bash
# Create conda environment
conda create -n looptool python=3.10
conda activate looptool

# Install requirements
cd LoopTool
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
We recommend following the official [Verl guidance](https://verl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/start/install.html) to correctly install the verl library.

## 📦 Seed Data Preparation
The scripts of seed data generation are organized in `dialog_generation` folder (`cd dialog_generation`). 

- The `tools` folder contains the complete set of tools. You may extendively incorporate custom tool sets. We provide 1.2w tool set descriptions scraped from [ToolBench](https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench).
- Run the data generation:
```bash
    python run.py --func data_crawl --raw_data_path ./dialogs/toolbench --tools_path tools/toolbench --used_models Qwen3-32B --is_en --use_plan --use_cot --thread_num 10 --crawl_num 1000
```

- Transform the dialogs into conversations:
Please configure the file path properly.
```bash
    # Please configure the file path properly.
    python trans2conversation.py
```

## 🚀 Training
The scripts of GRPO training are organized in `grpotool` folder.

- Transform the conversation into GRPO training samples

```bash
    cd grpotool/dataset

    # Please configure the file path properly.
    python utils/conversation_transform_grpo_qwen.py 

    # （Option） filter out the training sample
    python utils/filter_grpo_sample.py

    # Please configure the file path properly.
    python utils/json2parquet.py
```
- GRPO Training for Robust Tool call
```bash
    # Qwen3-8B (8 H800)
    bash train_grpo_qwen.sh

    # Qwen3-32B (32 H800)
    bash multinode_qwen32b.sh
```

## 🔄 Data and Model Iteration
The scripts of data iteration are organized in `dataloop` folder. Please configure the file path properly according to your dataset.

- Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) queries the fine-tuned model on the training corpus using greedy decoding, revealing mastered, borderline, and failure cases. 

- Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) employs Qwen3-32B to compare each prediction against its reference label.

- Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) transforms verified failure cases into new, structurally similar but contextually diverse challenging samples.

```bash
    cd dataloop

    # Greedy Capability Probing
    python greedy_capability_prob.py 

    # Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV)
    python judgement_label_verification.py

    # Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE)
    python error_data_expansion.py

    # (Option) filter the new-generated samples
    python filter_grpo_sample.py
```

Upon obtaining a new round of data, we load the checkpoint from the previous round’s model and employ the new data to conduct GRPO reinforcement learning training.

## Evaluation

### BFCL
We recommend following the [official BFCL guidelines](https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla/tree/main/berkeley-function-call-leaderboard) to configure the evaluation environment, and employing the handler located in bfcl/qwentool.py as the Handler during our model evaluation.

### ACEBench
In the ACEBench evaluation, we instruct the model to produce tool calls of the `<tool_call> </tool_call>` type in order to align with the training format of the model.
